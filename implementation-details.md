# Live editing
Possible ideas:
* Google OT
* No live editing, git branch & merge implementations
* Transmit and sync keystrokes, kinda like p2p netplay

## Google OT
pros:
* Seamless live editing
* Best solution
cons:
* Sounds hard to understand and implement lol

Materials:

## Git branch & merge
pros:
* Easiest implementation
cons:
* No live editing
* Manual merging

Materials:

## Transmit and sync keystrokes, kinda like p2p netplay
pros:
* Idk sounds fun to implement lol
* Already implemented by other people
cons:
* Rollback?
